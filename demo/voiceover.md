## Script

Jarspect. An AI-powered security scanner that detects malicious game mods before they compromise your system.

Millions of gamers download compiled Java mods every day. But beneath the surface, a seemingly innocent mod can hide credential stealers, ransomware, or botnet payloads. Traditional antivirus often misses these highly obfuscated threats.

Here's how Jarspect works.

You upload a compiled Java file. Our Static Analyzer decompiles the bytecode and looks for suspicious code patterns. Simultaneously, our Behavior Predictor uses AI to map out the mod's true intentions—like stealthy network calls or unauthorized file writes. 

Finally, the Verdict Engine synthesizes these signals into a clear risk score.

Let me show you a live scan. I'm uploading a suspicious mod now.

The UI shows the pipeline in action. The file is unpacked, and the agents go to work. 

In seconds, the system returns a verdict. It’s flagged as a critical risk. The AI detected obfuscated variables and an attempt to read sensitive browser session files.

We don't just give you a warning; Jarspect provides a detailed breakdown of exactly why this file is dangerous, pointing out the malicious indicators found within the decompiled code.

Fast, deep, and automated threat detection for the modding ecosystem. 

Built for the Microsoft AI Dev Days Hackathon twenty twenty-six. Thank you for watching.
